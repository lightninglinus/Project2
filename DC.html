		<p>You’ve learned about America’s capital city in textbooks, but there’s nothing like seeing the real thing up close—when you visit Washington, DC, you experience so much more than a portal to the past or a glimpse at the flexing power of government.</p>
		<p>John F. Kennedy may have once panned DC for its “Southern efficiency and Northern charm,” but recent years have secured its place as a world-class cultural capital. Always revered for its astonishing collection of museums and historical troves, DC also is a serious music, culinary, and nightlife hub. Explore its free museums, eat well in its explosion of new restaurants throughout town, tour craft breweries, and hear concerts at venues from the lauded Kennedy Center to the iconic 9:30 Club. T+L’s Washington, DC, travel guide will show you just what the city has beyond K Street and the White House.</p>
		<p>Perhaps the biggest cultural change in recent years, however, has happened in Washington’s dining scene. Now, the city boasts eateries from nationally regarded chefs like Jose Andres and Wolfgang Puck, but it’s garnered just as much attention for home-grown talent like Johnny Monis (Komi and Little Serow), Vikram Sunderam (Rasika), and Erik Bruner-Yang (Toki Underground). With a beer and cocktail culture equally as impressive, our Washington, DC city guide proves there’s a wealth of things to do that befit the nation’s capital.</p>
